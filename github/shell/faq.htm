<p>1.sudo的用法</p>
<p>Sudo 是一个允许系统管理员授权让普通用户执行部分或全部root命令的工具。这样可以减少root登陆提高系统安全性。 Sudo特点： 
1.可以限制特定的用户在特定的主机上运行指定的命令 2.有非常详细的日志纪录 3.sudo使用时间戳文件来执行类似&quot;检票&quot;系统。当用户使用sudo并且输入密码后，用户默认获得了一张存活期为5分钟的票(这个数值可以在编译的时候更改)，超过5分钟不用的话就需要重新输入密码才能使用 
sudo安装过程(略)：一般系统都默认有安装 配置文件/etc/sudoers： 以下简略介绍该文件的配置项(root使用visudo编辑该文件) </p>
<p>第一部分：# Host alias specification(主机别名定义，用于定义多台住机) 格式：Host_Alias SERVER = 
192.168.0.1/255.255.255.0 Host_Alias SERVER1 = 172.17.1.1 </p>
<p>第二部分：# User alias specification(用户别名定义，用于定义多组用户) </p>
<p>格式：User_Alias ADMIN = test,jack,tom User_Alias TEST = user1 </p>
<p>第三部分：# Cmnd alias specification (命令别名定义，定义用户执行命令列表) </p>
<p>格式：Cmnd_Alias CAT = /bin/cat /etc/sudoers Cmnd_Alias Ls = /bin/ls /root </p>
<p>第四部分：# Override built in defaults(增加日志纪录功能) </p>
<p>Defaults@SERVER log_host, logfile=/var/log/sudo.log #为host alise里的主机增加一个附加日志，如果这个日志需要保存多年，则可使用log_year，这样在日 
志纪录的时候将纪录详细的年份 下面详细解释配置实例： [test@redflag test]$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers # sudoers 
file. # # This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root. # # See 
the sudoers man page for the details on how to write a sudoers file. # </p>
<p># Host alias specification Host_Alias SERVER = 172.17.196.10 
#配置主机172.17.196.10别名SERVER;Host_Alias前不能有空格 # User alias specification 
User_Alias ADMIN = test,jack #配置用户组ADMIN，所属用户test,jack # Cmnd alias 
specification Cmnd_Alias CT = /bin/cat /etc/sudoers,/bin/cat /etc/shadow 
Cmnd_Alias CA = /bin/ls /root #配置命令别名CT，可以执行cat etc/sudoers,cat /etc/shadow 
命令，CA可执行 la /root命令 </p>
<p># Defaults specification </p>
<p># User privilege specification root ALL=(ALL) ALL test SERVER=CT,CA 
#配置test用户可以在SERVER执行cat /etc/sudoers,/cat /etc/shadow，ls </p>
<p>/root 命令 # test ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL(配置test可以执行所有的root命令，且使用sudo时不需要输入密码)
</p>
<p># Override built in defaults Defaults@SERVER log_host, logfile=/var/log/sudo.log 
#配置日志纪录到主机SERVER的/var/log/sudo.log文件 </p>
<p># Uncomment to allow people in group wheel to run all commands # %wheel 
ALL=(ALL) ALL </p>
<p># Same thing without a password # %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL </p>
<p># Samples # %users ALL=/sbin/mount /cdrom,/sbin/umount /cdrom # %users 
localhost=/sbin/shutdown -h now </p>
<p><font color="#FF00FF">日志文件</font>： 截取/var/log/sudo.log的一段纪录如下： </p>
<p>Mar 3 15:13:14 : test : HOST=redflag : command not allowed ; TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/test 
; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/ls /root Mar 3 15:13:18 : test : HOST=redflag : 
command not allowed ; TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/test ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/su - 
Mar 3 15:13:56 : test : HOST=redflag : TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/test ; USER=root ; 
COMMAND=/bin/cat /etc/sudoers Mar 3 15:14:10 : test : HOST=redflag : TTY=pts/0 ; 
PWD=/home/test ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/ls /root Mar 3 16:27:30 : test : HOST=redflag 
: TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/test ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/cat /etc/sudoers Mar 3 
16:29:47 : test : HOST=redflag : command not allowed ; TTY=pts/0 ; PWD=/home/test 
; USER=root ; COMMAND=/bin/cat /var/log/sudo.log </p>
<p>配置中碰到的问题： </p>
<p>1、主机名配置错误导致sudo不能执行和日志纪录。 错误提示：Sorry, user test is not allowed to execute 
'/bin/cat /etc/sudoers' as root on </p>
<p>localhost.localdomain. </p>
<p>解决：将其中的localhost改为真实主机名字或IP即可 </p>
<p>test localhost=/sbin/cat /etc/sudoers Defaults@localhost log_host /var/log/sudo.log
</p>
<p>2、命令别名列表中命令错误导致sudo不能执行 错误提示：[jackyu@localhost jackyu]$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers 
Sorry, user jackyu is not allowed to execute '/bin/cat /etc/sudoers' as root on
</p>
<p>localhost.localdomain. </p>
<p>解决：由于在Cmnd alias里定义的时候命令书写有误(Cmnd_Alias CAT = /bin/cat -n /etc/sudoers). 
执行：sudo cat -n /etc/sudoers [注]：不管在Cmnd alias里还是在# User privilege 
specification中指定命令，使用sudo运行时必须一 </p>
<p>摸一样，否则将出错。比如在Cmnd alias里指定某用户职能运行 /bin/cat /etc/sudoers,如果该用户登 </p>
<p>陆后运行 sudo /cat -n /etc/sudoers将会出错. </p>

<p>Troubleshooting tips and FAQ for Sudo </p>
<p>===================================== </p>
<p>Q) When I run configure, it says &quot;C compiler cannot create executables&quot;. A) 
This usually means you either don't have a working compiler. This could be due 
to the lack of a license or that some component of the compiler suite could not 
be found. Check config.log for clues as to why this is happening. On many 
systems, compiler components live in /usr/ccs/bin which may not be in your PATH 
environment variable. </p>
<p>Q) Sudo compiles but when I run it I get &quot;Sorry, sudo must be setuid root.&quot; 
and sudo quits. A) Sudo must be setuid root to do its work. You need to do 
something like `chmod 4111 /usr/local/bin/sudo'. Also, the file system sudo 
resides on must *not* be mounted (or exported) with the nosuid option or sudo 
will not be able to work. Another possibility is you may have '.' in your $PATH 
before the directory containing sudo. If you are going to have '.' in your path 
you should make sure it is at the end. </p>
<p>Q) Sudo compiles but when I run it I get &quot;seteuid(0) failed, your operating 
system may have broken POSIX saved ID support\nTry running configure with 
--disable-saved-ids&quot; and sudo quits. A) The operating system you are running 
probably has broken support for POSIX saved IDs. You should run configure with 
the &quot;--disable-saved-ids&quot; option and rebuild sudo. </p>
<p>Q) Sudo never gives me a chance to enter a password using PAM, it just says 
'Sorry, try again.' three times and exits. A) You didn't setup PAM to work with 
sudo. On Redhat Linux or Fedora Core this generally means installing sample.pam 
as /etc/pam.d/sudo. See the sample.pam file for hints on what to use for other 
Linux systems. </p>
<p>Q) Sudo says 'Account expired or PAM config lacks an &quot;account&quot; section for 
sudo, contact your system administrator' and exits but I know my account has not 
expired. A) Your PAM config lacks an &quot;account&quot; specification. On Linux this 
usually means you are missing a line like: account required pam_unix.so in 
/etc/pam.d/sudo. </p>
<p>Q) Sudo is setup to log via syslog(3) but I'm not getting any log messages. 
A) Make sure you have an entry in your syslog.conf file to save the sudo 
messages (see the sample.syslog.conf file). The default log facility is local2 
(changeable via configure). Don't forget to send a SIGHUP to your syslogd so 
that it re-reads its conf file. Also, remember that syslogd does *not* create 
log files, you need to create the file before syslogd will log to it (ie: touch 
/var/log/sudo). Note: the facility (&quot;local2.debug&quot;) must be separated from the 
destination (&quot;/var/adm/sudo.log&quot; or &quot;@loghost&quot;) by tabs, *not* spaces. This is a 
common error. </p>
<p>Q) When sudo asks me for my password it never accepts what I enter even 
though I know I entered my password correctly. A) If your system uses shadow 
passwords, it is possible that sudo didn't detect this. Take a look at the 
generated config.h file and verify that the C function used for shadow password 
lookups was detected. For instance, for SVR4-style shadow passwords, 
HAVE_GETSPNAM should be defined (you can search for the string &quot;shadow 
passwords&quot; in config.h with your editor). Note that there is no define for 
4.4BSD-based shadow passwords since that just uses the standard getpw* routines.
</p>
<p>Q) I don't want the sudoers file in /etc, how can I specify where it should 
go? A) Use the --sysconfdir option to configure. Ie: configure 
--sysconfdir=/dir/you/want/sudoers/in </p>
<p>Q) Can I put the sudoers file in NIS/NIS+ or do I have to have a copy on each 
machine? A) There is no support for making an NIS/NIS+ map/table out of the 
sudoers file at this time. A good way to distribute the sudoers file is via 
rdist(1). It is also possible to NFS-mount the sudoers file. </p>
<p>Q) I don't run sendmail on my machine. Does this mean that I cannot use sudo? 
A) No, you just need to run use the --without-sendmail argument to configure or 
add &quot;!mailerpath&quot; to the Defaults line in /etc/sudoers. </p>
<p>Q) When I run visudo it uses vi as the editor and I hate vi. How can I make 
it use another editor? A) Your best bet is to run configure with the 
--with-env-editor switch. This will make visudo use the editor specified by the 
user's EDITOR environment variable. Alternately, you can run configure with the 
--with-editor=/path/to/another/editor. </p>
<p>Q) Sudo appears to be removing some variables from my environment, why? A) 
Sudo removes the following &quot;dangerous&quot; environment variables to guard against 
shared library spoofing, shell voodoo, and kerberos server spoofing. IFS 
LOCALDOMAIN RES_OPTIONS HOSTALIASES NLSPATH PATH_LOCALE TERMINFO TERMINFO_DIRS 
TERMPATH TERMCAP ENV BASH_ENV LC_ (if it contains a '/' or '%') LANG (if it 
contains a '/' or '%') LANGUAGE (if it contains a '/' or '%') LD_* _RLD_* 
SHLIB_PATH (HP-UX only) LIBPATH (AIX only) KRB_CONF (kerb4 only) KRBCONFDIR 
(kerb4 only) KRBTKFILE (kerb4 only) KRB5_CONFIG (kerb5 only) VAR_ACE (SecurID 
only) USR_ACE (SecurID only) DLC_ACE (SecurID only) </p>
<p>Q) How can I keep sudo from asking for a password? A) To specify this on a 
per-user (and per-command) basis, use the 'NOPASSWD' tag right before the 
command list in sudoers. See the sudoers man page and sample.sudoers for 
details. To disable passwords completely, run configure with the 
--without-passwd option or add &quot;!authenticate&quot; to the Defaults line in 
/etc/sudoers. You can also turn off authentication on a per-user or per-host 
basis using a user or host-specific Defaults entry in sudoers. </p>
<p>Q) When I run configure, it dies with the following error: &quot;no acceptable cc 
found in $PATH&quot;. A) /usr/ucb/cc was the only C compiler that configure could 
find. You need to tell configure the path to the &quot;real&quot; C compiler via the 
--with-CC option. On Solaris, the path is probably something like &quot;/opt/SUNWspro/SC4.0/bin/cc&quot;. 
If you have gcc that will also work. </p>
<p>Q) When I run configure, it dies with the following error: Fatal Error: 
config.cache exists from another platform! Please remove it and re-run 
configure. A) configure caches the results of its tests in a file called 
config.cache to make re-running configure speedy. However, if you are building 
sudo for a different platform the results in config.cache will be wrong so you 
need to remove config.cache. You can do this by &quot;rm config.cache&quot; or &quot;make 
realclean&quot;. Note that &quot;make realclean&quot; will also remove any object files and 
configure temp files that are laying around as well. </p>
<p>Q) I built sudo on a Solaris &gt;= 2.6 machine but the resulting binary doesn't 
work on Solaris &lt;= 2.5.1. Why? A) Starting with Solaris 2.6, snprintf(3) is 
included in the standard C library. To build a version of sudo on a &gt;= 2.6 
machine that will run on a &lt;= 2.5.1 machine, edit config.h and comment out the 
lines: #define HAVE_SNPRINTF 1 #define HAVE_VSNPRINTF 1 and run make. </p>
<p>Q) When I run &quot;visudo&quot; it says &quot;sudoers file busy, try again later.&quot; and 
doesn't do anything. A) Someone else is currently editing the sudoers file with 
visudo. </p>
<p>Q) When I try to use &quot;cd&quot; with sudo it says &quot;cd: command not found&quot;. A) &quot;cd&quot; 
is a shell built-in command, you can't run it as a command since a child process 
(sudo) cannot affect the current working directory of the parent (your shell).
</p>
<p>Q) When I try to use &quot;cd&quot; with sudo the command completes without errors but 
nothing happens. A) Some SVR4-derived OS's include a /usr/bin/cd command for 
reasons unfathomable. A &quot;cd&quot; command is totally useless since a child process 
cannot affect the current working directory of the parent (your shell). </p>
<p>Q) When I run sudo it says I am not alllowed to run the command as root but I 
don't want to run it as root, I want to run it as another user. My sudoers file 
entry looks like: bob ALL=(oracle) ALL A) The default user sudo tries to run 
things as is always root, even if the invoking user can only run commands as a 
single, specific user. This may change in the future but at the present time you 
have to work around this using the 'runas_default' option in sudoers. For 
example: Defaults:bob runas_default=oracle would achieve the desired result ofr 
the preceding sudoers fragment. </p>
<p>Q) How do you pronounce `sudo'? A) soo-doo (for superuser do).</p>
